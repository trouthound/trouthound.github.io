<h1>Blogs Related to the RS2 and Rim</h1>
  
<p>The blog entries below are screen shots from the original RS2 web page.  They will take longer to load than before.  I expect to change these back to text in the future. Please note that the information contained in the links below came from Rim many years ago and he may have refined his approach to nymphing since.</p>
