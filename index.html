  <h1>Welcome to the New RS2 Home Page</h1>
  <p>I needed to migrate the RS2 web page off HostGator as it became too expensive for me.  I'll try to keep as much of the content as I can. However, note that you can find tying instructions for the RS2 on YouTube.  The tying videos I'll reference show Rim Chung, the originator of the RS2.</p>
  <p>If you wish to learn how Rim ties his flies, you can search YouTube for Rim Chung Ties the RS2 or Rim Chung Ties the Avatar Fly ( or see the links below ). The latter fly is similar to the RS2, but has no tail and is tied on a curved hook. Rim provided commentary while tying these flies. The videos on YouTube are available in high definition ( 720p ).</p>
  <p>You may copy content from this site unless it’s noted otherwise.   However, borrowed content must reference this site as the source.</p>
  <p>Questions and comments about the RS2 Home Page can be sent to ferenc.horvath@gmail.com.  I’ll reply as time allows.</p>
