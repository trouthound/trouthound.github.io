  <h1>Welcome to the New RS2 Home Page</h1>
  <p>I needed to migrate the RS2 web page from HostGator as it became too expensive for me keep it up as a retiree.  I'll try to retain as much of the original content as I can. You can also find tying instructions for the RS2 on YouTube.  The tying videos I'll reference below show Rim Chung, the originator of the RS2 tying his fly.</p>
  <p>If you wish to learn how Rim ties his flies, you can simply search YouTube for <b>Rim Chung Ties the RS2</b> or <b>Rim Chung Ties the Avatar Fly</b> ( or see the links below ). The <b>Avatar</b> is similar to the RS2, but has no tail and is tied on a curved hook. Rim provided commentary while tying these flies. The videos on YouTube are available in high definition ( 720p ).</p>

  <p>Rim experiments with other fly designs periodically, which he fishes as his second fly in a two fly rig.  One of them is called the <b>plebby</b> which can be found <b><a href="./images/plebby.html">here</a></b>.</p>
