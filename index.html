  <h1>Welcome to the New RS2 Home Page</h1>
  <p>I needed to migrate the RS2 web page off HostGator as it became too expensive for me.  I'll try to keep as much of the content as I can. However, note that you can find tying instructions for the RS2 on YouTube.  The tying videos I'll reference show Rim Chung, the originator of the RS2.</p>
