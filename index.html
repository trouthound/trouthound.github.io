  <p>Please note that I needed to <b>quickly migrate</b> the RS2 web pages from HostGator due to their recent <b></b>steep rate increase</b>.  http://www.rs2fly.com now gets forwarded to https://trouthound.github.io. <b>GitHub</b> provides some basic web page hosting for free. I've kept all of the original contents--some of it in the form of screenshots. In the future I'll make the pages look more attractive.  The original <b>RS2 Home Page</b> was posted on the Internet in 1998.  This is the fourth time it had to be moved over the years.</p>
  
<p>The tying videos below show <b>Rim Chung</b>, the originator of the RS2 tying his flies. His newer fly, the <b>Avatar</b>, has been thoroughly tested for over 10 years.  It is similar to the RS2, but has no tail and is tied on a curved hook. Rim provided commentary in the videos while tying his flies.</p>

  <p>Rim experiments with other fly designs periodically, which he fishes as his second fly in a two fly rig.  One of them is called the <b>plebby</b> which can be found <b><a href="./images/plebby.html">here</a></b>.</p>
