  <h1>Welcome to the New RS2 Home Page</h1>
  <p>I needed to migrate the RS2 web page from HostGator as it became too expensive for me, a retiree.  I'll try to keep as much of the original content as I can. However, note that you can also find tying instructions for the RS2 on YouTube.  The tying videos I'll reference below show Rim Chung, the originator of the RS2 tying his fly.</p>
  <p>If you wish to learn how Rim ties his flies, you can simply search YouTube for <b>Rim Chung Ties the RS2</b> or <b>Rim Chung Ties the Avatar Fly</b> ( or see the links below ). The <b>Avatar</b> is similar to the RS2, but has no tail and is tied on a curved hook. Rim provided commentary while tying these flies. The videos on YouTube are available in high definition ( 720p ).</p>
